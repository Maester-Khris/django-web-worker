## Project Setup
To use our project, ensure that you have the following packages installed:

- Daphne: An ASGI server for running your application.
- Beautiful Soup: A library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
- Selenium: A tool for automating web browsers.

## Installation
You can install the required packages using pip: <br>
`pip install daphne beautifulsoup4 selenium`

## Future Improvements
I am considering enhancing the project architecture to ensure that the scraper does not interfere with the operation of future web applications. My research has pointed me toward using Django Background Tasks and Celery for better task management.
If you have any ideas or suggestions for improving this repository, please feel free to share! I would love to collaborate with you.
